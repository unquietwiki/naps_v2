Updated by Michael Adams, http://unquietwiki.com, 2012

=== Changelog from original version ===

10-2012
* Uses .NET 4.5 instead of .NET 3.0; might not work on Windows XP now, but does work on Windows 7 x64 (binaries are still 32-bit).
* PDF output from PDF Sharp is poorly optimized: switched to LPGL-licensed "PDF Clown"; http://www.stefanochizzolini.it/en/projects/clown/index.html
* Randomized filenames: was not available before.
* Correct file types for saved images; also defaulted to JPEG (.NET PNG output is non-optimized).

=== TODO ===

10-2012
* Make sure my own users are happy with this build.
* Contact original author + make sure he can integrate the changes into his build.
* Address any outstanding bugs if the original has been abandoned.

=== Licensing ===

The original was licensed as GPL version 2, and thus this modified version as well.
